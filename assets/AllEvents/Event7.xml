        You continue walking through the dark forest, you are most certainly lost..
        You get reminded about the fact that people need food and water to survive, and you have neither..
        However, that is the least of your problems, and you forget everything about your hunger as you hear a roar from one of the bushes.
        You don’t even have the time to think about running away before the foe charges towards you.
        It’s time to fight for your life
